## About

This is the vanilla PHP version of my pet project "Employee Directory".<br/>
It contains a set or entities that expose CRUD functionality over HTTP.<br/>
This was my setup in the period when I was creating common AMFPHP backend services for Flex and Angular.

## Setup

1. Run "database.sql" in a new MySQL database
2. Update "config.db.php" to point to your database
3. Update "config.php" to match your checkout path and your url in local apache setup
